        "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain function. It consists of interconnected nodes, called neurons or artificial neurons, organized in layers. Each connection between neurons has an associated weight, and the neurons apply activation functions to their inputs.\n",

        "#### Key Components of Neural Networks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Neuron (Node):**\n",
        "   - The basic building block of a neural network.\n",
        "   - Each neuron receives inputs, applies weights, sums them up, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Layer:**\n",
        "   - Neurons are organized into layers: input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.\n",
        "   - The input layer receives the initial data, hidden layers process information, and the output layer produces the final result.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Weights:**\n",
        "   - Connections between neurons are represented by weights.\n",
        "   - These weights are adjusted during training to learn from data and make accurate predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Activation Function:**\n",
        "   - Each neuron typically applies an activation function to its weighted sum of inputs.\n",
        "   - Common activation functions include sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Feedforward:**\n",
        "   - In a feedforward neural network, information travels one way—from input to output—without cycles or loops.\n",

        "6. **Backpropagation:**\n",
        "   - Backpropagation is an algorithm used for training neural networks.\n",
